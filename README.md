Passionate about the intersection of products and businesses with data science and functional design.
I'm currently working with Platforms Data Science team at Uber in San Francisco. <br><br>
On the side I love researching urban policy in the developing world, playing the piano, and fiddling with Abelton Live. <br><br>
